/**
 * Immutable input parameters for agent execution containing all necessary context and
 * configuration.
 * <p>
 * This record encapsulates all the information required to initiate and configure an
 * agent run, including conversation history, available tools, execution context, and
 * identification metadata. The input serves as a complete specification for how the agent
 * should execute and what resources it has access to.
 * <p>
 * Being a record, RunAgentInput is immutable and automatically provides equals(),
 * hashCode(), and toString() implementations based on its components.
 *
 * @param threadId unique identifier for the conversation thread this run belongs to, used
 * for tracking and associating related agent executions
 * @param runId unique identifier for this specific agent run instance, allowing for
 * precise identification and tracking of individual executions
 * @param state the initial state for the agent execution, containing any persistent data
 * or configuration that should be maintained across interactions
 * @param messages the conversation history leading up to this execution, including all
 * user and agent messages that provide context for the current run
 * @param tools the list of available tools that the agent can invoke during execution,
 * defining the agent's capabilities and available actions
 * @param context additional context objects that provide environmental information,
 * constraints, or configuration for the agent execution
 * @param forwardedProps arbitrary properties forwarded from the calling context, allowing
 * for flexible extension and custom configuration without modifying the core input
 * structure
